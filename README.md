# RT73-utils

This Python script is designed to upload and download codeplugs from the Retevis RT73 radio (Also known as the Kydera CDR-300UV)

It can download them, decompile them into a more friendly JSON format, and recompile and reupload them.

It can now upload 'ham contacts' to the radio, slightly quicker than the CPS can.. ~198k contacts in around 40 minutes :)

It can also upgrade the radio's firmware.

It's based entirely on my reverse engineering, and is available under GPL v3.0

Any questions, please ask.

Please have a read of this project's wiki for information about some 'Gotchas', in particular relating to APRS.
