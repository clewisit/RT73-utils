# RT73-utils

This Python script is designed to upload and download codeplugs from the Retevis RT-73 radio (Also known as the Kydera CDR-300UV)

It can download them, decompile them into a more friendly JSON format, and recompile and reupload them.

It can also upgrade the radio's firmware.

It's based entirely on my reverse engineering, and is available under GPL v3.0

Any questions, please ask
